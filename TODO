* Extract from information from captured Mode S messages. Currently we only
  decode what is trival to decode.
* Decode CPR encoded latitude and longitude, display it in normal and
  interactive mode.
* Show nationality in interactive mode and normal mode using the
  aircraft ICAO address, like: 30xxxx -> Italy.
* Actually use the fancy --debug feature in order to improve the recognition
  algorithm if possibile.
